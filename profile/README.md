👋 Welcome to the Interdisciplinary Brazilian Symposium on Agent-Based Models ([SIMBRA]((https://simbra.com.br))) page on GitHub!

We are an interdisciplinary community dedicated to advancing Agent-Based Modeling ([ABM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model)) in Brazil as a vital tool for investigating [complex phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system). By fostering collaboration between researchers and students across diverse fields, the organization promotes open scientific practices and provides technical training in platforms like [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/), [Gama](https://gama-platform.org/), and [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/) to solve contemporary challenges.

Our work is guided by three core principles:

- [**Low Threshold, No Ceiling**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/2004/netlogo-swarmfest2004.pdf): We believe all our activities should be welcoming and accessible to beginners, without limiting how far experts can explore and contribute.
- **Interdisciplinarity**: We believe that combining insights from different fields is essential to enrich how we discuss and apply ABMs.
- **Horizontality**: We believe in self-managing as a organization and producing clear, accessible content that avoids unnecessary jargon or barriers, while maintaining strong scientific rigor.

Join us in exploring ABMs and their role in understanding and addressing complex challenges.
